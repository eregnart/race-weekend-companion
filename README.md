# 🏁 Race Weekend Companion (WIP)

A mobile-first companion app designed for motorsport fans, with a focus on F1 and local Australian events. The goal is to deliver live schedules, timing info, and offline-friendly features for race day environments where internet access is limited.

## 🚧 Status: In Development

This project is currently in the early planning and setup stages.  
Key goals include:

- [ ] Build a Progressive Web App (PWA) using React + Tailwind CSS  
- [ ] Implement low-data **Track Mode** for poor network conditions  
- [ ] Display live session schedules and leaderboards (mock data first)  
- [ ] Add support for **local motorsport events** (Supercars, QR, club days)  
- [ ] Enable offline caching for schedules and events

## 💡 Motivation

At large events like Formula 1 or Supercars races, fans often struggle with poor connectivity. This app is designed to work in those conditions, giving fans a reliable, lightweight companion with all the key info they need.
